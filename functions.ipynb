        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    In Python, functions and methods are both used to perform a block of code when called, but they have a key difference based on how they are used and where they are defined.\n",
        "    - A function is a block of code that is defined using the def keyword and is not associated with any object (unless it is inside a class, in which case it may be a method).\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "    - A method is a function that is associated with an object (i.e., it is defined inside a class). It automatically takes the instance (self) as the first parameter when it's called on an object.\n",
        "    -Example:\n",
        "    class Greeter:\n",
        "    def greet(self, name):\n",
        "        return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "    g = Greeter()\n",
        "    g.greet(\"Alice\")  # 'greet' is a method here\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Parameters are variables listed in the function definition.They are placeholders for the values the function will receive when called.\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "    - Arguments are the actual values you pass into the function when you call it.\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    greet(\"Alice\")  # \"Alice\" is the argument\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The most common way to define and call function in python is using def keyword.\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    def greet(name):\n",
        "    # return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "    # Calling it:\n",
        "    # greet(\"Alice\")\n",
        "    - You can assign default values to parameters:\n",
        "    - example:\n",
        "    def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    greet()           # Uses default\n",
        "    greet(\"Bob\")      # Overrides default\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The return statement in a Python function is used to send a result back to the caller. It effectively ends the function and hands a value (or values) back to wherever the function was called.\n",
        "    - example: def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "    result = add(3, 4)\n",
        "    print(result)  # Outputs: 7\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "    An iterator is an object that keeps its state (remembers where it is in a sequence).\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
        "    iterator = iter(my_list)     # Now we have an iterator\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(next(iterator))  # 10\n",
        "    print(next(iterator))  # 20\n",
        "    print(next(iterator))  # 30\n",
        "    # next(iterator) -> raises StopIteration\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "    A generator is a special type of iterator that yields items one at a time using the yield keyword instead of return.There are two ways to create generators:first way is instead of return, you use yield to produce a value.\n",
        "    second is Generator Expression (like a compact version of a list comprehension).\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    def count_up_to(n):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= n:\n",
        "        yield count\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Generators offer several practical advantages over regular functions, especially when you're working with large data, streams, or performance-critical tasks.Generators don’t store the entire sequence in memory.Regular functions with lists return all values at once, which can eat up memory.Generators can model things like infinite number series or event streams without crashing your system.A regular function can't do this — it would try to return an infinite list!.\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    # List: stores all numbers in memory\n",
        "    def make_list(n):\n",
        "    return [i for i in range(n)]\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Generator: yields numbers one by one\n",
        "    def make_generator(n):\n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        yield i\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "    A lambda function is a small, anonymous function — basically a one-liner that doesn’t need a name.Lambda functions are often used inline (where you need a quick throwaway function),as arguments to higher-order functions (like map(), filter(), sorted()).\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    square = lambda x: x * x\n",
        "    print(square(5))  # Output: 25\n",
        "9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The map() function is used to apply a function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.), and returns a map object (an iterator) with the results.\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Square each number\n",
        "    squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums)\n",
        "\n",
        "    print(list(squared))  # [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    map(), filter(), and reduce() are all powerful functional programming tools in Python — they help you process and transform data without writing explicit loops.\n",
        "    - example of map reduce and filter:\n",
        "    map:\n",
        "    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "    squared = map(lambda x: x ** 2, nums)\n",
        "    print(list(squared))  # [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
        "    reduce:\n",
        "    from functools import reduce\n",
        "\n",
        "    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "    total = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)\n",
        "    print(total)  # 10\n",
        "    filter:\n",
        "    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "    evens = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums)\n",
